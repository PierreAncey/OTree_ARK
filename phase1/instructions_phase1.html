    To understand the origin of the videos and how the game works, here is some important information.

    <br>
    <br>

    We asked 300 participants to give a speech about their performance in a game equivalent to Trivial Pursuit. This game involved diverse knowledge questions in six thematic categories:

    <br>
    <br>

    <div class="row justify-content-center">
        <div class="col-auto texte justify-content-center">
            <ul style="text-align: left;">
                <li>Leisure</li>
                <li>Geography</li>
                <li>Sports & Recreational Activities</li>
                <li>History</li>
                <li>Natural Sciences</li>
                <li>Arts & Literature</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    </div>

    <br>
    The game follows two simple rules: 

    <br>
    <br>

    <div class="row justify-content-center">
        <div class="col-auto texte justify-content-center">
            <ul style="text-align: left;">
                <li>The available time for each question was 15 seconds.</li>
                <li>Each question had only one correct answer out of the four options.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    </div>

    <br>

    The game consisted of a total of 60 questions. To better understand how the game works, the 300 participants first tried six questions before giving the speech. You will now try the six questions for yourself as well. When you are ready, click the arrow to proceed to the next page. The game will start at that point.
