        <h3>Phase 1</h3>
        <br>

        You will watch 6 videos containing speeches about a game similar to Trivial Pursuit. The game and its rules will be explained first. After that, you will watch the speeches before moving on to phase 2.

        <h3>Phase 2</h3>
        <br>

        You will have an additional 20 minutes to freely rewatch each of the 6 videos. Afterward, you will receive CHF20 (approx. 18Â£), and you will be asked to decide how much you want to allocate to one, two, or three speeches. It will be particularly important to allocate resources optimally as you will earn a return on investment based on the speeches you have invested in.
